    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>
        At Organic Life Fenthree, we cultivate and sell organic, pesticide-free agricultural products from
        Okayama. In 2008, we received certification from Okayama Prefecture and began cultivation in
        certified organic pesticide-free fields. We transitioned from conventional farming practices
        dependent on pesticides and chemical fertilizers to a cultivation approach focused on organic soil
        management. Our foundation is based on organic practices, prioritizing the use of organic methods in
        cultivation.
        In Okayama Prefecture, we proactively promote organic farming that prioritizes the creation of soil
        without relying on chemical fertilizers and synthetic pesticides, emphasizing the natural ecosystem.
        As a pioneering effort nationwide, in the fiscal year 1988, Okayama Prefecture established the
        "Okayama Prefecture Organic Pesticide-Free Agriculture Promotion Guidelines" and initiated the
        certification system for organic pesticide-free agricultural products. The organic pesticide-free
        agricultural products from Okayama, certified under the JAS (Japanese Agricultural Standards)
        criteria, adhere to even stricter standards.

    <h2>Store information</h2>
    <p>
        In greenhouse cultivation, we grow tomatoes, cucumbers, and leafy greens in the relatively warm
        climate of Okayama. For tomatoes, we cultivate large-sized Momotaro tomatoes and cherry tomatoes. As
        for leafy greens, our main crops include spinach, komatsuna (Japanese mustard spinach), and salad
        greens.In the beautiful natural surroundings of Okayama, known as the "Land of Sunshine," we are
        dedicated to cultivating safe vegetables through organic and pesticide-free methods. Nearby, there
        are national important cultural properties such as the Mozu-Furuichi Kofungun (keyhole-shaped burial
        mounds) and the five-story pagoda of Kokubunji Temple.

        In our alley cultivation, we grow a variety of vegetables based on the seasons, including lettuce,
        sunny lettuce, onions, eggplants, bell peppers, radishes, and carrots. Recently, we have also
        started cultivating superfoods such as green papaya, kale, and beets.
